This is my second attempt at my own website. I'm choosing to build it with the Debian, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP (L.E.M.P. stack) becuase they are all foreign to me. My last try used Lightsail to host a NodeJS server. Overtime I got frustrated with NodeJS because the guides I'd use all said "Download this, than put these three lines of codes here and here. Boom your website now has authentication". I felt the exact same way during my coding bootcamp, not learning anything except to plug and play. I don't expect to recreate every single library with this new project, but I at least wish to know why I am including somethings instead of only the how to use. This is draglisting 2.0! (name will change, I am also not content with it)
